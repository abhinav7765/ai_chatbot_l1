  utter_groundwater_laws:
    - text: |
        This law aims to protect and ensure the availability of clean groundwater for everyone, both in rural and urban areas.

        Groundwater is crucial for drinking, farming, and industry, but it’s facing a serious crisis due to overuse and pollution.

    - text: |
        The law emphasizes the need for fair and environmentally-friendly management of groundwater to tackle problems like farmer suicides and climate change.

        Groundwater is a shared resource, not private property, and must be managed with everyone’s best interest in mind.

    - text: |
        The Supreme Court of India recognizes water as a basic human right, and this law strengthens the role of local governments in managing groundwater.

        To protect drinking water and livelihoods, a new legal framework is necessary to ensure that groundwater is used responsibly and sustainably.

  utter_groundwater_monitoring_details:
    - text: >
        Groundwater monitoring involves measuring levels, quality, and temperature of groundwater through a network of observation wells. Key attributes include:
        - **Groundwater Level**: Measured four times a year (January, April/May, November).
        - **Groundwater Quality**: Samples collected annually (April/May) to assess regional quality changes.
        - **Temperature**: Recorded as part of quality monitoring.
        The monitoring network started in 1969 with the Central Ground Water Board and includes 15,653 wells across the country.

        - **September**: Actual 192.0 mm (111% of LPA 173.4 mm)
        - **August + September**: Actual 453.7 mm (104% of LPA 434.7 mm)

  utter_climatic_parameters_details:
    - text: >
        Climatic parameters affecting groundwater regimes include:
        - **Rainfall**: Directly influences recharge levels.
        - **Evapotranspiration**: Affects the water balance and recharge.
        - **Temperature**: Impacts evaporation rates and groundwater recharge.
        Anthropogenic factors include aquifer depletion, irrigation, and waste disposal.
  utter_groundwater_levels_details:
    - text: >
        In November 2012, groundwater levels varied across India as follows:
        - **Sub-Himalayan Areas, North of River Ganges, Eastern Coast of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Northeast, Coastal Tamil Nadu**:
          Depth generally ranges from 2-5 meters below ground level (bgl). About 37% of wells fall in this range.
        - **Shallow Water Levels (Less than 2 m bgl)**:
          Observed in West Maharashtra, Assam, North Bihar, Orissa, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
        - **North-Western States**: Depth typically ranges from 10-20 m bgl.
        - **Western Parts of the Country**: Deeper water levels of 20-40 m bgl and more than 40 m bgl. North Gujarat, parts of Haryana, and Western Rajasthan show levels greater than 40 m bgl.
        - **West Coast**: Generally less than 5 m bgl, with isolated pockets in Western Maharashtra having less than 2 m bgl.
        - **East Coast**: Coastal Andhra Pradesh has shallow levels less than 2 m bgl.
        - **Eastern States**: General range of 2-5 m bgl. Southeastern West Bengal has levels of 5-10 m bgl and 10-20 m bgl.
        - **South India**: Typically 5-10 m bgl, with some isolated pockets showing more than 10 m bgl.
        
        Overall, the distribution is:

        - **2-5 m bgl**: 36% of wells
        - **5-10 m bgl**: 27% of wells
        - **10-20 m bgl**: 14% of wells
        - **20-40 m bgl**: 3% of wells
        - **More than 40 m bgl**: Remaining wells


  utter_groundwater_level_effects:
    - text: |
        Groundwater level fluctuations can have significant effects on the environment, economy, and society.

        **Effects of Declining Groundwater Levels:**
        - **Water Scarcity:** Decreased availability for drinking, irrigation, and industrial use, leading to reduced agricultural productivity.
        - **Land Subsidence:** Excessive extraction can cause ground sinking, damaging infrastructure like roads and buildings.
        - **Deterioration of Water Quality:** Lower levels can lead to contaminant intrusion, such as seawater, and increased pollutant concentration.
        - **Impact on Ecosystems:** Drying up of wetlands and rivers, leading to loss of biodiversity.
        - **Increased Energy Costs:** More energy is required to pump water from deeper levels, raising costs.
        - **Social and Economic Impacts:** Water shortages can lead to conflicts and migration due to affected livelihoods.

        **Effects of Rising Groundwater Levels:**
        - **Flooding and Waterlogging:** Can cause flooding and damage to infrastructure and agriculture, and hinder crop growth.
        - **Contamination of Surface Water:** Elevated levels can push contaminants into surface water bodies.
        - **Structural Damage:** Rising water tables can weaken foundations, leading to structural instability.

        **Managing Groundwater Levels:**
        - **Sustainable Water Use:** Implement water-saving technologies and reduce extraction to balance levels.
        - **Groundwater Recharge:** Techniques like artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting can help replenish levels.
        - **Policy and Regulation:** Stricter regulations on extraction and NOC enforcement can help manage use.
